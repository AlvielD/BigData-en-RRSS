The description of the task to be performed on this module is showed on the file [TareaMÃ³dulo2.txt](https://github.com/AlvielD/BigData-en-RRSS/blob/master/M%C3%B3dulo%202%20-%20Extracci%C3%B3n%2C%20procesamiento%20y%20an%C3%A1lisis%20de%20Twitter%20con%20R/TareaM%C3%B3dulo2.txt)

The script I developed for this task is included on the file [MozillaThunderbird.R](https://github.com/AlvielD/BigData-en-RRSS/blob/master/M%C3%B3dulo%202%20-%20Extracci%C3%B3n%2C%20procesamiento%20y%20an%C3%A1lisis%20de%20Twitter%20con%20R/MozillaThunderbird.R). The script looks for those tweets that contains the word "mozilla thunderbird" and rank the 5 most liked
tweets. The results are plotted on the graph showed in [Rplot.jpeg](https://github.com/AlvielD/BigData-en-RRSS/blob/master/M%C3%B3dulo%202%20-%20Extracci%C3%B3n%2C%20procesamiento%20y%20an%C3%A1lisis%20de%20Twitter%20con%20R/Rplot.jpeg)

**Developed project:**

The project developed for this module consisted on the analysis and visualization of a dataset extracted 
from twitter. The extraction of the data is performed on [this](https://github.com/AlvielD/BigData-en-RRSS/blob/master/M%C3%B3dulo%205%20-%20An%C3%A1lisis%20de%20redes%20sociales%20con%20Gephi/DescargaTweetsGephi.ipynb) Python script
and store on the file [covid_tweets.csv](https://github.com/AlvielD/BigData-en-RRSS/blob/master/M%C3%B3dulo%205%20-%20An%C3%A1lisis%20de%20redes%20sociales%20con%20Gephi/covid_tweets.csv) then the data is transformed to make it readable for Gephi, this is done with [this](https://github.com/AlvielD/BigData-en-RRSS/blob/master/M%C3%B3dulo%205%20-%20An%C3%A1lisis%20de%20redes%20sociales%20con%20Gephi/ConversorTweets-Gephi.R) R script.
Finally, the analysis is performed in Gephi thanks to the transformed data (all the .gephi files) that are imported in the program.
The analysis can be seen on the following [report](https://github.com/AlvielD/BigData-en-RRSS/blob/master/M%C3%B3dulo%205%20-%20An%C3%A1lisis%20de%20redes%20sociales%20con%20Gephi/Tarea_M%C3%B3dulo5.pdf).
